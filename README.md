##  Project Overview

Welcome to **Happy Wraps**, a creative and fun full stack web project developed as part of my learning journey in web development.

Though I come from an **ECE (Electronics and Communication Engineering)** background, I discovered my passion for **software development**, which led me to take **Full Stack Development training at Novitech** under the mentorship of **Bharani Chandar**.

This project reflects my transition into the world of coding and web design — bringing smart ideas to life!
